In this folder, the user can find all heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous cases used.


## Note:
All of cases simulated the flow field, reaction has not been considered here.

For heterogeneous cases, the user can find different condition from the name of folder. 
    * For example, "flow_hete_m4_0.1m/s" refers to the heterogeneous case, where the interval is 4 cm and the flow velocity is 0.1 m/s.

For homogenous cases, the user can find different condition from the name of folder. 
    * For example, "flow_homo_m4_0.1m/s_geo" refers to the homogeneous case based on geometric method, where the interval is 4 cm and the flow velocity is 0.1 m/s.
    * For example, "flow_homo_m4_0.1m/s_nde" refers to the homogeneous case based on numerical darcy experiment method, where the interval is 4 cm and the flow velocity is 0.1 m/s.
