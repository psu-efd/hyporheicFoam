# This example case is for Alpha_forward paper.

# In this folder, you can find the setup of simulation, like BC/IC.
# Before run the simulation, the user need to run blockmesh to generate the mesh files.

# Here, we added all simulated cases, to simulate solute transport, 
  the user need to pre-simulate the flow to steady state and then use the pre-simulated flow field to simulate the solute transport.
# This case solves scalar transport in both the surface and subsurface domains. And the dynamic coupling at SWI is fully considered.
