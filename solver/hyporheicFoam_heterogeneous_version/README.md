This is a solver based on OpenFOAM for hyporheic flows (coupled surface
and subsurface flows).

## Note: ##
* two-way coupling only for now, i.e., with feedback from the subsurface to the surface flow.  
* using this solver to solve case.
* In this heterogeneous version, a permeability field has been add to study the heterogeneous sediment.

## Credit: ##
* This code uses some of the functionalities of OpenFOAM.
