This repository is for the code and cases of hyporheicFoam, a sovler based on OpenFOAM for hyporheic flow and coupled biogeochemcial reative transport. 

The directory "utilities" contains tools for pre- and post-processing.

The code is developed with OpenFOAM v5. To use this code, it is required that OpenFOAM has been properly installed. Current code has only been used in Linux. Porting to Windows and Mac OS have not been done, but possible.
